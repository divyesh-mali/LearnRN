In short,

Lifecycle methods in React Native (and React) are special methods that get called at different stages of a component's life. They allow you to hook into specific points of the component's lifecycle, such as when it is being created, updated, or destroyed. Here are the main lifecycle methods:
1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting
4. Error handling

This is given in very short. You can search and study in detailed.
